				<p>
					Hello, I am Nathanial Hapeman and I develop software. <br> <br style="line-height: .1em"/>
					I have a broad range of interest in the programs I develop. 
					For my 
					<a href="projects.html" rel="bookmark" title="Nate's Project"> latest project </a>
					I am developing a multi-directional shooter for iOS. Besides games, I have developed
					programs like letter recognition software, N-Body simulations, a media player 
					similar to iTunes, and many others you can check out
					<a href="projects.html" rel="bookmark" title="Nate's Projects"> here</a>. 
					I am most comfortable programming in
					c/c++ but I am familiar with java, python, lua, bash scripting, html, css, and matlab.
					Check out my 
					<a href="resume.pdf" rel="bookmark" title="Nate's Resume"> resume </a>
					for a quick summary of my background.

				<h2>Backstory</h2>
			</header>

			<content>
				<p> 
					Oddly enough, Computer Science was not my major in College; it was
					Mechanical Engineering. See I grew up working on cars and dirt bikes 
					so I thought Mechanical Engineering was the appropriate major for me. 
					This all changed when I took a course on Matlab in my third year as a 
					Mechanical Engineering student. The final project for this class was to 
					create anything you want in Matlab just as long as it was challenging. 
					I jumped on this opportunity and created a 3D simulation of a racecar 
					driving around a track doing flips over obstacles, drifts around turns, 
					and wheelies here and there.
					It was a fun, creative process and gave me a feeling inside that most
					mechanical engineering classes did not. 
					For my next big project, I decided to create a letter recognition software
					program even though I had no clue what computer vision was. When I was finished
					I realized something.
					<br><br>I was addicted to programming...<br><br>
					And so I took an introductory course on c++ in what should have been my
					final quarter at UCR. At that point, I had a choice between graduating
					or pursuing a minor in Computer Science. I choose to pursue a minor
					and took nothing but Computer Science courses straight to get it. But
					for most companies, having a minor in Computer Science is not enough.
					So in whatever free time I have, I develop. I have created some pretty
					awesome programs among them a Super Mario Brothers clone
					which took a whole summer to create. Currently, I am developing a game for
					iOS that is very similar to geometry wars. I plan on publishing it for free 
					when I am done to get my name out there. Check out my <a href="projects.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to this POST TITLE"> projects page </a> for more
					projects I have done.

				I developed this game completely from scratch using just c/c++ and SDL.

				I am developing this game to be like Geometry Wars (a multidirectional shooter) 
				but with a couple of twist. I plan on publishing it for iOS as soon as I am
				done adding a couple of features.
