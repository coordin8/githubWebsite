				<h2> Quick Intro</h2>

			<p>
				Hello, I am Nathanial Hapeman and I develop software. <br> <br>
				I have a broad range of interest in the programs I develop. 
				For my 
				<a href="projects.html#shooter">latest project </a>
				I am developing a multi-directional shooter for iOS. Besides games, I have developed
				programs like letter recognition software, N-Body simulations, a media player 
				similar to iTunes, and many others you can check out
				<a href="projects.html" rel="bookmark" title="Nate's Projects"> here</a>. 
				I am most comfortable programming in
				c/c++ but I am familiar with java, python, lua, bash scripting, html, css, javascript, and matlab.
				Check out my 
				<a href="resume.pdf" rel="bookmark" title="Nate's Resume"> resume </a>
				for a quick summary of my background.

				<h2>Backstory</h2>
			</header>

			<p> 
				Oddly enough, Computer Science was not my major in College; it was
				Mechanical Engineering. See I grew up working on cars and dirt bikes 
				so I thought Mechanical Engineering was the appropriate major for me. 
				This all changed when I took a course on Matlab in my third year as a 
				Mechanical Engineering student. The final project for this class was to 
				create anything you want in Matlab just as long as it was challenging. 
				I jumped on this opportunity and created a 3D simulation of a racecar 
				driving around a track doing flips over obstacles, drifts around turns, 
				and wheelies here and there.
				This project actually got top in class and got me a bonus of 5% extra credit towards my total grade but I did not care about that. I created that program because it was fun! For my next big project, I decided to create a letter recognition software
				program even though I had no clue what computer vision was. When I was finished I realized something.

				<br><br>I was addicted to programming...<br><br>

				And so I took an introductory course on c++ in what should have been my
				final quarter at UCR. At that point, I had a choice between graduating
				or pursuing a minor in Computer Science. Midway though the quarter it was obvious I had to get a minor. Following that quarter, I took nothing but Computer Science courses straight till I had a minor. Now I understand that most companies might be looking for someone with more expereince than a minor so in whatever free time I have, I develop. I have created some pretty awesome programs. Currently, I am developing a game for
				iOS that is very similar to geometry wars. I plan on publishing it for free when I am done to get my name out there. Check out my <a href="projects.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to this POST TITLE"> projects page </a> for more projects I have done.
