					<h2> Quick Intro</h2>

				<p>  <br>
					<b>Hello, I am Nathanial Hapeman and I develop software.</b> <br> <br>
					I have a broad range of interest in the programs I develop. I am currently employed for
					as a software engineer for an awesome company out in Glendale so I am currently not looking
					for a new job. I am not able to go into any details of that job but I will mention that I
					am working with a vareity of programming langauges and libraries. As of now I have dabbled
					with c++, javascript (jquery,kineticJS, and ajax), html/css, python, and bash. It has been pretty
					awesome so far. The coolest thing is how big the code base is. It was a little overwhelming at
					first and truthfully still is but its been an amazing learning experience. I am still doing
					some private developing on the side but not nearly as much since my job and driving consumes
					the bulk of my day.

					<br><br> <b>Here are some the indepent projects I have worked on or am currently working on. </b> <br><br>

					For my
					latest project
					I am developing a tower defense game for iOS (in addition to some other stuff). Besides games, I have developed
					programs like letter recognition software, N-Body simulations, a media player
					similar to iTunes, and many others you can check out
					<a href="projects.html" rel="bookmark" title="Nate's Projects"> here</a>.
					I am most comfortable programming in
					c/c++ but I am familiar with java, python, lua, bash scripting, html, css, javascript, Objective-C, and matlab.

					for a quick summary of my background.

					<h6>University of California, Riverside </h6> <br>
					BS in Mechanical Engineering, minor in Computer Science - 3.14 <br>
					Only considering Computer Science Minor          - 3.63

					I have done most of my learning out of college though. All of my projects except one were built outside of school and I have taken several online classes like Machine Learning online.

					<h2>Backstory</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I discovered programming through Matlab while taking classes as a Mechanical Engineer. I quickly learned that I had a knack for it when I won a programming competition for one of my classes. Students were required to create a program demonstrating their skills in Matlab. I choose to develop a race simulation and got best in class. Soon after I decided to program for fun and to advance my kowlendge in the subject. I started developing other simulations but they did not challenge me. So I decided to develop some letter recognition software without ever opening a book on computer vision. It was a blast creating it but  I realized I was more passionate for Computer Science than I was for Mechanical Engineering. In what should have been my last year as a Mechanical Engineer I decided to minor in Computer Science. With the exception of a quarter, I took nothing but Computer Science classes straight to get a minor and I loved every second. While doing this, I took online classes on Computer Vision and other topics and privately developed games and apps for fun.
					<br>
					Now I recently graduated in December 2013 and am still privately developing. Since then I have finished several projects like a Super Mario Brothers clone, an itunes clone, and have developed several games like Pacman. I am currently learning Unity and Blender to create a first person shooter and am privately developing a website for a company.

					Here! Have a look at my most recent game I made...
