						I created this Pacman Clone using JavaScript for fun and as a
						good learning experience. I made sure the game would run 30 FPS
						smoothly by making some crazy optimizations. For instance, rather
						than rendering everything in the level each frame, I only render
						were the changes happen in the game. I also made sure I used the
						best Data Structures and algorithms so no unnecessary work was done.
						The hardest thing was creating the AI for the ghost. In order to
						do this, I had to transform the original two dimensional array map
						into a graph. The ghost can then navigate through the map using
						the nodes as reference points. They can use these nodes to move
						towards Pacman by checking which node Pacman is going towards, or to
						move around the map randomly. The orange ghost in the
						original Pacman moves this way but most peope don't notice since they
						are trying to survive. Now to get each ghost to move towards
						Pacman I used Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the fastest path.
						This was tricky to implement because again I wanted the game to run
						smoothly at 30 FPS. All in all, this was an awesome learning
						experience that taught me a lot about JavaScript OOP.

						This is a project I recently built to help learn javascript. It started off as an online tutorial but I went my seperate way when I realized the tutorial started to implement one of the functions with O(m*n) time with m and n being the size of the board. I realized a way to reduce it to constant time and went my seperate way after that. Test it out but watch out for some of the sound effects! I designed it to give you a shock when you hit a bomb.
